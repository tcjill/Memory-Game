Memory Game Project

A Udacity project using HTMl, CSS and JavaScript.

How To Play:
This is a memory matching card game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs total. Click on a card and find its match on the game board. You will have one try before the card flips back so choose carefully.The game ends once all pairs are matched.

Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the Star Rating, how many moves have been made and how long it takes to finish the game.
